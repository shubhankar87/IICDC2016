Project title: Automated Irrigation System using energy harvesting
In this project, the farm is divided into grids and each grid has Self Developed Capacitive Sensors embedded in it. These sensors measure the change in dielectric and send it further to the circuit comprising of 555 timer and 74LS14. The code which is attached is used to measure the frequency of the digital pulse generated by the 555 timer.

The data collected through various sensors is to an RF which is present in each grid. From there all these data are stored in the main hub. Also we use CC3200 WiFi Module to take the prediction from some weather forecasting sites and this is also stored in the main hub.

According to the data stored the respective solenoid tap is opened and the grid is watered. We have used Solar Panels to power our project. So overall our project is a low cost, low power consuming system which can irrigate the farm automatically.
